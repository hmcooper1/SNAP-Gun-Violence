# SNAP-Gun-Violence
**Research Question** 
To what extent is food security, a basic need, through SNAP associated with mass shootings gun violence in the United States?
**Overview**
This project explores the relationship between access to basic food benefits, provided by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and gun violence rates. We hypothesize that food security fosters society stability and reduces gun violence. Using data from 2017 to 2019, we analyse mass shootings at the county level, incorporating data from the U.S. Census and SNAP participation records.
